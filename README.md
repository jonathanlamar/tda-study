## Week 1

Basic point-set topology. Read chapters 2 and 3 of Munkres. Maybe solve some
exercises or plot some examples.

## Week 2

Basic point-set continued. Read Chapter 1 of Bradley, Bryson, and Terilla
(sections on product and quotient toplogies). Maybe solve exercises.

## Week 3

Basic Homotopy Theory. Read Chapter 0 of Hatcher and section 3.1 of Aguilar et
al. Work through examples.

## Week 4

Review, next steps.

## Week 5

Define simplicial and persistent homology (TODO: Write up notes).

## Week 6

Compute example: Sliding window function on time series data, compute PHOM on
de-trended data.
