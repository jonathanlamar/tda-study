# Week 1: Basic Point-Set Topology

## Chapter 2

It took a really long time to settle on a definition of Topology, as well as a
definition for _a_ topology. To the first point, my grad Topology professor
said that Topology is best defined as _the intrinsic geometry of a space_. But
what is intrinsic, what is geometry, and what is a space?

I think intrinsic refers to the invariance of topology under distortions,
without which we would be doing analysis. Defining _space_ is also nontrivial,
which might explain why the axioms of a topology aren't the most intuitive.

Some guiding intuitions to keep in mind are:

1. Open sets encode the information of nearness and farness without a metric to
   measure distance, however open sets should always be thought of as analogues
   of open _intervals_ (discs, hyperspheres) in Euclidean space.
2. Canonical topologies should always be thought of as universal constructions
   whenever possible (i.e., any good canonical topology should be able to be
   defined as either the finest or coarsest topology satisfying some
   relationship to other, related spaces).
