# Week 2: Basic Point-Set Topology 2

## Some Topologies as Universal Constructions

### Absolute bare minimum category theory needed for this to make sense

A _cone_ over a diagram is an object that maps to every object in the diagram,
in a way such that all "triangles" commute. Keeping in mind that everything in
category theory is a category, there is a category of cones over a diagram.
Likewise, there is a category of co-cones under a diagram (arrows generally move
down and to the right. An object is _initial_ in a category if it has a unique
map to every other object. Likewise an object is _terminal_ if it accepts a
unique map from every other object.

The _limit_ of a diagram is the terminal co-cone (if it exists) over the
diagram, and the _colimit_ of the diagram is the initial co-cone onder the
diagram. The product is the limit over the factors, and the quotient is the
colimit of a surjection.

In the category of topological spaces, the limits of diagrams are always endowed
with the finest possible topology that allows the cone maps, and colimits are
always endowed with the coarsest possible maps that allow the co-cone maps to
exist. For a relatively straightforward illustration, note that all maps from
the discrete topology are continuous and all maps to the indiscrete topology are
continuous.

More generally, another explanation for why you should think of fine topologies
as "sitting to the left of" coarse topologies is that if a set $X$ is endowed
with two topologies $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$, forming distinct
_topological spaces_ $X_1$ and $X_2$, then the identity map $X_1 \to X_2$ is
continuous if and only if $\mathcal{T}_1$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}_2$.

### Some other notes

Other things I read that sound interesting. Ignore for now.

- Functors generalize points (Huh?). This seems like a really insightful
  statement for modern math. It has something to do with the Yoneda lemma,
  but I'm not sure how to make the statement precise. I mean, you can
  identify points of a space using the functor Hom($\ast$, $-$), but that's
  not identifying individual points...
- Filters generalize sequences. This is pretty clear from the definion. It's
  nice too, since filters are categorical constructions (sorta) and work in
  more general spaces.

### Product Topology

Ok, with that in mind, we can now see why the product topology is not the box
topology. By definition, the product topology is generated by the sub-basis
given by preimages of open sets under the projection maps, and this gives the
coarsest possible topology with these sets open (i.e., with the projection maps
continuous... Refer to the previous paragraph...).

However, the basis generated by this sub-basis is _not_ the set of all boxes.
Due to the finite intersection property of producing a basis from a sub-basis,
it is as originally defined.

Another remark is that it isn't trivial to a category theorist that the
underlying set should evn by the cartesian product. But the continuity of the
forgetful functor from Top to Set implies it.

Nice properties of product spaces:

1. Products of Hausdorff spaces are Housdorff.
2. Taking the product of the closures of subsets in the factors is equivalent to
   taking the closure of the product of those subsets.

### Quotient Topology

This requires a bit of a setup. Suppose we have a surjection $q:X\to Y$, where
$X$ is a topological space and $Y$ is any _set_. Note that even ignoring
continuity, the preimages of points of $Y$ form a partition of $X$. Let
$X^\ast$ be the set consisting of the parts of this partition, and let $p:X\to
X^\ast$ be the map that takes a point to its equivalence class. Let
$f:X^\ast\to Y$ be the function which takes an equivalence class $[x]$ to
$q(x)$. Then by definition of the partition forming $X^\ast$, $f$ is
well-defined. It is also a bijection, so as sets, we can generally identify the
image of anyh bijection with the set $X^\ast$ defined in this construction.
This is to say, that any surjection can be represented by some identification of
points under an equivalence relation.

There is a natural topology on $X^\ast$ which can be defined as the _finest_
topology that makes $p$ continuous. This is defined by allowing the open sets
to be any set whose pre-image under $p$ is open.

Similarly, we can define the analogous topology on $Y$. Both of these
topologies are referred to as _the quotient topology_. Note that the quotient
topology endows $p$ (also $q$) with the property of being an _open map_.

### Subspace Topology

Not a lot to say here. It also has a categorical definition (coarsest topology
to make an injection continuous). Note the open sets of $A\subseteq X$ are
therefore the intersections of open sets of $X$ with $A$. This means they may
not be open in $X$ (only if $A$ is open in $X$).
