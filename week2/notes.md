# Week 2: Basic Point-Set Topology 2

## Some Topologies as Universal Constructions

### Absolute bare minimum category theory needed for this to make sense

Just read [these blog posts](https://www.math3ma.com/categories/category-theory)
first.

- For now, just think of a category as a giant "meta-space of spaces." There is
  one for every type of spaces that you might want to consider. For instance,
  the "collection" of all topological spaces is a category.
- Categories have objects and arrows. The objects are the spaces, and the
  arrows are the relationships between them. In the category of topological
  spaces, the objects are topological spaces, and the arrows (also called
  morphisms) are continuous functions.
- In category theory, we are often concerned with _diagrams_. These have a
  technical meaning that is not that important, because you are intuitively
  familiar with diagrams. It's a bunch of objects and maps between them.
  Unless otherwise specified, diagrams are usually only interesting if they
  are _commutative_.
- Another important concept in category theory is _universality_. This shows up
  in one of two ways: An object $A$ is called _initial_ if for all $B$, there
  is a unique morphism $A\to B$. Conversely $Z$ is called _terminal_ if for
  all $Y$, there is a unique morphism $Y\to Z$.

A _cone_ over a diagram is an object that maps to every object in the diagram,
in a way such that all "triangles" commute. Keeping in mind that everything in
category theory is a category, there is a category of cones over a diagram.
Likewise, there is a category of co-cones under a diagram (arrows generally move
down and to the right. An object is _initial_ in a category if it has a unique
map to every other object. Likewise an object is _terminal_ if it accepts a
unique map from every other object.

The _limit_ of a diagram is the terminal co-cone (if it exists) over the
diagram, and the _colimit_ of the diagram is the initial co-cone onder the
diagram. The product is the limit over the factors, and the quotient is the
colimit of a surjection.

In the category of topological spaces, the limits of diagrams are always endowed
with the finest possible topology that allows the cone maps, and colimits are
always endowed with the coarsest possible topology that allow the co-cone maps to
exist. For a relatively straightforward illustration, note that all maps from
the discrete topology are continuous and all maps to the indiscrete topology are
continuous.

More generally, another explanation for why you should think of fine topologies
as "sitting to the left of" coarse topologies is that if a set $X$ is endowed
with two topologies $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$, forming distinct
_topological spaces_ $X_1$ and $X_2$, then the identity map $X_1 \to X_2$ is
continuous if and only if $\mathcal{T}_1$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}_2$.

### Product Topology

Ok, with that in mind, we can now see why the product topology is not the box
topology for infinite products. By definition, the product topology is generated
by the sub-basis given by preimages of open sets under the projection maps, and
this gives the coarsest possible topology with these sets open (i.e., with the
projection maps continuous... Refer to the previous paragraph...).

However, the basis generated by this sub-basis is _not_ the set of all boxes.
Due to the finite intersection property of producing a basis from a sub-basis,
it is as originally defined.

Another remark is that it isn't trivial to a category theorist that the
underlying set should even be the cartesian product. But the continuity of the
forgetful functor from Top to Set implies it.

Nice properties of product spaces:

1. Products of Hausdorff spaces are Housdorff.
2. Taking the product of the closures of subsets in the factors is equivalent to
   taking the closure of the product of those subsets.

### Subspace Topology

Not a lot to say here. It also has a categorical definition (coarsest topology
to make an injection continuous). Note the open sets of $A\subseteq X$ are
therefore the intersections of open sets of $X$ with $A$. This means they may
not be open in $X$ (only if $A$ is open in $X$).

### Some other notes along these lines

Other things I read that sound interesting. Ignore for now.

- Functors generalize points (Huh?). This is related to the Yoneda lemma, which
  allows a very modern perspective on topology and geometry called the
  _Functor of Points Perspective_ (or maybe the _Grothendieck School_). Very
  abstract stuff, but basically it says that spaces are completely determined
  by their relationships to other spaces. For more, see
  [here](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/the-yoneda-perspective).
- Filters generalize sequences. This is pretty clear from the definion. It's
  nice too, since filters are categorical constructions (sorta) and work in
  more general spaces.
